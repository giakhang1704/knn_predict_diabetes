**KNN Diabetes Prediction**

This project uses a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier to predict diabetes outcomes based on the PIMA Indians Diabetes Dataset. The Jupyter notebook knn_predict_diabetes.ipynb implements data loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and comparison with other classifiers.



**Project Structure**
- knn_predict_diabetes.ipynb: The main Jupyter notebook containing the code for loading data, preprocessing, training a KNN model, evaluating its performance, and comparing it with Logistic Regression and Random Forest models.
- diabetes.csv: The dataset used for training and testing the model (not included in this repository; ensure it is available in the working directory).
- requirements.txt: Lists the Python dependencies required to run the notebook.



**Dataset**
- The dataset used is the PIMA Indians Diabetes Dataset
The dataset should be named diabetes.csv and placed in the same directory as the notebook.



**Installation**
- Clone this repository or download the notebook and requirements.txt file.
- Ensure Python 3.12.3 or a compatible version is installed.
- Install the required dependencies by running:
      pip install -r requirements.txt
- Place the diabetes.csv dataset in the same directory as the notebook.
- Open the Jupyter notebook:
       jupyter notebook knn_predict_diabetes.ipynb



**Requirements**
The required Python libraries are listed in requirements.txt. Key dependencies include:
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- seaborn
- matplotlib
